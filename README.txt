Advanced Facebook Instant Articles integration for WordPress

== Description ==

A better implementation of Facebook Instant Articles for WordPress.

**Content Parsing**
A large part of the complexity of integrating Instant Articles is the rigorous content structure
imposed. Due to the WYSIWYG editor and the plethora of plugins and themes available, WordPress content
tends to be rather unstructured. Most of the current Facebook Instant Article plugins don't really take
account of this and either produce invalid content or strip parts out. This plugin is a concentrated effort
to correctly format any WordPress content it could possibly come across. You can read more about the challenges and
solutions in (this blog post)[https://wp-native-articles.com/blog/formatting-wordpress-html-content-instant-articles/].

**PRO Version**

The (Pro version)[https://wp-native-articles.com/] of the plugin comes with full Facebook Instant Articles API integration and has
advanced features such as:

* Publish, un-publish and manage Instant Articles from the WP article page.
* Override global settings on a per article basis.
* Facebook Articles synced instantly with WP ones.
* Errors & import status live in every article.
* Full instant article analytics, individual and aggregated site overview.
* Branded articles.
* Premium support.

**Future**
A few of the features planned for the near future.

* Image options manager
* Embed manager (ads, related articles, anything)
* WP Comments
* Advanced stats & weekly roundup
* CLI & API integration
